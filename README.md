# Walmart Product Scraper

## Overview

​	This code is intended to scrap a given walmart's product webpage and return to the user it's title,  current price, original price, the product's image and a description. 

​	All of those infos are found in the product webpage.

​	The reason for this code is to test some functionalities of the libs used and further functionalities can be added using that data, but I wont be doing that here. Feel free to use it as you want.

## Requirements

​	To install the required libs, just use the following command

​		`$ pip3 install requirements.txt `
